# Module-6-Python-API-
 To create a Python script to visualize the weather of over 500 cities of varying distances from the equator.  The citipy Python libraryLinks to an external site., the OpenWeatherMap APILinks to an external site, to create a representative model of weather across cities.

Weather.py file is used to find the weather coordinates across 500 cities. Random geographic coordinates and the nearest city to each latitude and longitude combination is provided.
Weather data can be retrieved by OpenWeatherMapAPI .Next, to create scatter plots to showcase the following relationships:

Latitude vs. Temperature

Latitude vs. Humidity

Latitude vs. Cloudiness

Latitude vs. Wind Speed

Also to compute Linear Regression for each in Northern and Southern Hemisphere.

VactationPy 

Based on the weather data , to find the places of choice for vaction . By using the geoViews Python library, and the Geoapify API.
Find the hotels for accomodation in radius of 10000 mts and display in dataframe hotel_df .
1.Create a map that displays a point for every city in the city_data_df .The size of the point should be the humidity in each city.
2.Add the hotel name and the country as additional information in the hover message for each city in the map.
